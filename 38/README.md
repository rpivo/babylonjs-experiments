## Experiment 38: The Node Class

#### New to Me
- The Node class is the basic class for all scene objects (Mesh, Light, Camera).
- The Node constructors takes in a couple arguments:
  - `name`: a string representing the name and id to be given to this node.
  - `scene`: a `Nullable<Scene>` that's the scene this node will be added to.
