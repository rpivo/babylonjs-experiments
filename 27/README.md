## Experiment 27: The UniversalCamera Class

#### New to Me
- The UniversalCamera class is typically used for first person shooter style games and play.
- It works with a variety of media, including keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepads.
- UnviersalCamera replaces FreeCamera.
- FreeCamera still works but is a legacy class.
