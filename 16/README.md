## Experiment 15: WebGL2

#### New to Me
- As of 2017, the current version of WebGL is WebGL2.
- This is based off of OpenGL ES3.0, whereas WebGL was based off of OpenGL ES2.0.
- There are lots of changes between WebGL2 and WebGL, none of which I fully understand.
- WebGL2 is still not supported on a lot of browsers.
