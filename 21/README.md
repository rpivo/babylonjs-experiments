## Experiment 21: The Scene Class

#### New to Me
- The Scene class constructor takes in an instance of the Engine class, and an optional `options` object.
- The Scene class represents a scene to be rendered by the engine.
- The scene is somewhat like the stage on which all the meshes are placed to be seen and the cameras and lights are placed that make them viewable.
