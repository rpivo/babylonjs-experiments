## Experiment 50: Types of Engines

#### New to Me
- The ThinEngine class is the base engine class (the root of all engines).
- Babylon.js has a few built-in engine classes: `ThinEngine`, `Engine`, and `NullEngine`.
- As expected `Engine` has more properties than `ThinEngine`.
- The null engine class provides support for a headless version of babylon.js.
- This can be used in a server-side scenario, or for testing purposes.
- Babylon.js also has 4 physics engines as plugins: cannon.js, oimo.js, energy.js, and ammo.js
