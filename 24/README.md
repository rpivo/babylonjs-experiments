## Experiment 24: The Color3 Class

#### New to Me
- The Color3 Class is a class used to hold a RBG color.
- The Color3 class constructor takes in three parameters: `red`, `green`, and `blue`, which are all a number between 0 and 1.
- There is also another color class called Color4 that represents an RGBA color.
- There is also a Color3Gradient class, which modifies a Color3 instance with a gradient.
