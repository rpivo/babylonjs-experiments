## Experiment 48: Scene - render Property

#### New to Me
- "render the scene" (from the docs).
- `render` takes in two optional arguments:
  - `updateCameras`: a boolean that indicates if cameras must update according to their inputs (true by default).
  - `ignoreAnimations`: a boolean that indicates if animations should not be executed (false by default).
