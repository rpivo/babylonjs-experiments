## Experiment 59: Building Custom React Hooks

#### New to Me
- Building your own hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.
- This can be useful if hook logic can be reused across files/components.
- A custom hook is a JavaScript (or TypeScript) function whose name starts with "use" and that may call other hooks.
- Two components using the same custom hook do not share state.
