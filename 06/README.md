## Experiment 06: TypeScript Overloads

#### New to Me
- In TypeScript definition files, we can declare the same definition multiple times, which allows the definition to have a variety of signatures.
- The **babylon.d.ts** file does this, with 793 overloads!
- We can declare overloads inside declaration files, or inside a regular `.ts` file.
