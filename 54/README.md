## Experiment 54: Radians

#### New to Me
- A radian is the angle made when the radius is wrapped round the circle.
- 1 radian is about 57.2958 degrees.
- In a half circle, there are Pi number of radians.
- Pi radians = 180 degrees.
- 1 radian = 180 degrees divided by Pi (57.2958).
- To go from radians to degrees, multiply by 180 and divide by Pi.
- To go from degrees to radians, multiply by Pi, divide by 180.
