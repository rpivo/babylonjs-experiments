## Experiment 11: Intro to OpenGL

#### New to Me
- OpenGL stands for **Open Graphics Library**.
- OpenGL is a cross-language, cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
- WebGL is derived from **OpenGL ES2.0.**, which is a subset of OpenGL.
- The "ES" in OpenGL ES2.0 stands for "Embedded Systems".
- OpenGL ES2.0 is intended for mobile devices.
- WebGL has less capabilities and is simpler to use as compared to OpenGL ES2.0.
- WebGL is also designed to run in a browser, and has therefore a few limitations more than OpenGL ES2.0.
