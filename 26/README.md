## Experiment 26: The FreeCamera Class

#### New to Me
- This class is used as the camera in the introductory example.
- It represents a free type of camera.
- It can be useful in a first person shooter type of game.
- The UniversalCamera adds more functionality to the FreeCamera, and should be considered for use instead.
- the UnversalCamera is considered a replacement of the FreeCamera.
