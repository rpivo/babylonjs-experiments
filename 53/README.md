## Experiment 53: The ArcRotateCamera Class

#### New to Me
- This represents an orbital type of camera.
- This camera always points toward a given target position.
- It can be rotated around the target with the target as the center of rotation.
- It can be controlled with cursors or mouse, or touch events.
- Think of this camera as one orbiting its target position.
- You can also think of it as a spy satellite orbiting the Earth.
- Its position relative to the target (Earth) can be set by three parameters:
  - alpha (radians) of the longitudinal rotation.
  - beta (radians) of the latitudinal rotation.
  - radius of the distance from the target position.
