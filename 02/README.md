## Experiment 03: Loaders

#### New to Me
- The intro example includes a link to a CDN script for babylon.js loaders: https://preview.babylonjs.com/loaders/babylonjs.loaders.min.js
- This is a collection of plugins that enable loading filetypes such as .gltf, .obj, and .stl.
- glTF (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications: https://www.khronos.org/gltf/
- OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file
- STL (an abbreviation of "stereolithography") is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)
