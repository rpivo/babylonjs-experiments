## Experiment 58: Using Babylon.js With React

#### New to Me
- You can use the @babylonjs/core with React.
- This page shows how you can set up a SceneComponent JSX file: https://doc.babylonjs.com/resources/babylonjs_and_reactjs
- There is also a TypeScript .tsx example available here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianzinn/babylonjs-hook/master/src/babylonjs-hook.tsx
- The example is also available in this babylonjs-hook package: https://github.com/brianzinn/babylonjs-hook
- For a more opinionated approach to using React with Babylonjs, there is react-babylonjs: https://github.com/brianzinn/react-babylonjs
