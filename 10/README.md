## Experiment 10: Intro to WebGL

#### New to Me
- WebGL stands for **Web Graphics Library**.
- WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plugins.
- WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 `<canvas>` elements.
