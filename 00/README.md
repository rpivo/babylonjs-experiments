## Experiment 1: Shader Programs

#### New to Me
- A shader is a program that runs in the graphics pipeline and tells the computer how to render each pixel.
- These programs are called shaders because they're often used to control lighting and shading effects.
- Most shaders are coded for (and run on) a graphics processing unit (GPU).
