## Experiment 20: Passing in a WebGLRenderingContext to the Engine Class Constructor

#### New to Me
- The Engine class constructor's first parameter is `canvasOrContext`.
- In the introductory example, I passed in a pointer to a `<canvas>` element.
- In this example, I'm passing in a `WebGLRenderingContext`.
- There doesn't seem to be any noticeable difference from passing in a context instead of the `<canvas>` element directly.
