## Experiment 01: Coding Conventions

#### New to Me
- The babylon.js library adheres to a certain coding style, which will likely be used while building things with babylon.js.
- babylon.js has a page called **Follow Approved Naming Conventions**: https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/approved_naming_conventions
- Private variables are named starting with `_` : `_myVariable`
- Camel casing is used for non static properties/functions/variables: `var myUberUsefulVariable`
- Pascal casing must be used for "static" functions: `BABYLON.Vector3.Project`
- Braces ({}) must be used for every block, even when there is only one line.
- Braces start on the same line and end on the next one.
- Each new file must contain only one class.
