## Experiment 08: Babylon Window Objects

#### New to Me
- When running the intro example, there appear to be a number of Babylon related objects that get attached to the window.
- The `BABYLON` module appears to contain all the classes available to the module. These are all the globals. For more details, see: https://doc.babylonjs.com/api/globals
- `LOADERS` is attached to the window at `window.LOADERS`. This appears to be loaded in from `https://preview.babylonjs.com/loaders/babylonjs.loaders.min.js` in the index.html file.
- `PointerEventsPolyfill` is attached to the window at `window.PointerEventsPolyfill`. This appears to be loaded in from `https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.1/pep.js` in the index.html file.
