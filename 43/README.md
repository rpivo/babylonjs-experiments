## Experiment 43: The Mesh Class - Updating Position

#### New to Me
- In the intro example, we use the MeshBuilder class to create a `Sphere` and a `Ground`.
- Both of these have a `position` property that can be updated.
- In the intro example, we update the sphere's `position.y`.
- We do not need to first 'instance up' the position value with a `new Vector3` in order for us to set `position.y`.
