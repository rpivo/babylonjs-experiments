## Experiment 75: Running the Development Environment

#### New to Me
- One last thing that needs to be done -- the `serve.sh` script needs to be executable:
```sh
chmod +x sh/serve.sh
```
- Then, `npm run dev` can be run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
- It Works! There were no immediate isues with deleted .js files.
